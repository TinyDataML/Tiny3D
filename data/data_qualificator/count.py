    """Estimates the number of label issues in the `labels` of a dataset.

    This method is **more accurate** than ``sum(find_label_issues())`` because its computed using only
    the trace of the confident joint, ignoring all off-diagonals (which are used by `find_label_issues` and are harder to
    estimate). Here, we sum over only diagonal elements in the joint (which have more data
    are more constrained, and therefore easier to compute).

    TL;DR: use this method to get the most accurate estimate of number of label issues when you
    don't need the indices of the label issues.

    You can use this method to label issues by using `num_label_issues` as the cutoff threshold
    used with ranking/scoring functions from :py:mod:`cleanlab.rank` with `num_label_issues`. There
    are two cases when you should use this approach instead of :py:func:`filter.find_label_issues <cleanlab.filter.find_label_issues>`:
      1. As we add more label and data quality scoring functions in :py:mod:`cleanlab.rank`, this approach will always work.
      2. If you have a custom score to rank your data by label quality and you just need to know the cut-off of likely label issues.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.array
      An array of shape ``(N,)`` of noisy labels, i.e. some labels may be erroneous.
      Elements must be in the set 0, 1, ..., K-1, where K is the number of classes.

    pred_probs : np.array
      An array of shape ``(N, K)`` of model-predicted probabilities,
      ``P(label=k|x)``. Each row of this matrix corresponds
      to an example `x` and contains the model-predicted probabilities that
      `x` belongs to each possible class, for each of the K classes. The
      columns must be ordered such that these probabilities correspond to
      class 0, 1, ..., K-1. `pred_probs` should have been computed using 3 (or
      higher) fold cross-validation.

    confident_joint : np.array, optional
      An array of shape ``(K, K)`` representing the confident joint, the matrix used for identifying label issues, which
      estimates a confident subset of the joint distribution of the noisy and true labels, ``P_{noisy label, true label}``.
      Entry ``(j, k)`` in the matrix is the number of examples confidently counted into the pair of ``(noisy label=j, true label=k)`` classes.
      The `confident_joint` can be computed using :py:func:`count.compute_confident_joint <cleanlab.count.compute_confident_joint>`.

    In other words, this function forces the confident joint to have the
    true noisy prior ``p(labels)`` (summed over columns for each row) and also
    forces the confident joint to add up to the total number of examples.

    This method makes the confident joint a valid counts estimate
    of the actual joint of noisy and true labels.

    Parameters
    ----------

      *Format requirements*: for dataset with K classes, labels must be in 0, 1, ..., K-1.

      The major difference in how this is calibrated versus single-label is that

    using observed labels and predicted probabilities pred_probs.

    This estimate is called the confident joint.

    When ``calibrate=True``, this method returns an estimate of
    the latent true joint counts of noisy and true labels.

    Important: this function assumes that `pred_probs` are out-of-sample
    holdout probabilities. This can be :ref:`done with cross validation <pred_probs_cross_val>`. If
    the probabilities are not computed out-of-sample, overfitting may occur.

    This function estimates the joint of shape ``(K, K)``. This is the
    confident counts of examples in every class, labeled as every other class.

    Under certain conditions, estimates are exact, and in most
    conditions, the estimate is within 1 percent of the truth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.array
      An array of shape ``(N,)`` of noisy labels, i.e. some labels may be erroneous.
      Elements must be in the set 0, 1, ..., K-1, where K is the number of classes.

    pred_probs : np.array, optional
      An array of shape ``(N, K)`` of model-predicted probabilities,
      ``P(label=k|x)``. Each row of this matrix corresponds
      to an example `x` and contains the model-predicted probabilities that
      `x` belongs to each possible class, for each of the K classes. The
      columns must be ordered such that these probabilities correspond to
      class 0, 1, ..., K-1. `pred_probs` should have been computed using 3 (or
      higher) fold cross-validation.

    K : optional
      Number of unique classes. Calculated as ``len(np.unique(labels))`` when ``K=None``.

    thresholds : array_like, optional
      An array of shape ``(K, 1)`` or ``(K,)`` of per-class threshold
      probabilities, used to determine the cutoff probability necessary to
      consider an example as a given class label (see `Northcutt et al.,
      2021 <https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125>`_, Section
      3.1, Equation 2).

      This is for advanced users only. If not specified, these are computed
      for you automatically. If an example has a predicted probability
      greater than this threshold, it is counted as having true_label =
      k. This is not used for pruning/filtering, only for estimating the
      noise rates using confident counts.

    calibrate : bool, default=True
        Calibrates confident joint estimate ``P(label=i, true_label=j)`` such that
        ``np.sum(cj) == len(labels)`` and ``np.sum(cj, axis = 1) == np.bincount(labels)``.

    multi_label : bool, optional
      If ``True``, labels should be an iterable (e.g. list) of iterables, containing a
      list of labels for each example, instead of just a single label.
      The multi-label setting supports classification tasks where an example has 1 or more labels.
      Example of a multi-labeled `labels` input: ``[[0,1], [1], [0,2], [0,1,2], [0], [1], ...]``.
      The major difference in how this is calibrated versus single-label is that
      the total number of errors considered is based on the number of labels,
      not the number of examples. So, the calibrated `confident_joint` will sum
      to the number of total labels.

    return_indices_of_off_diagonals : bool, optional
      If ``True``, returns indices of examples that were counted in off-diagonals
      of confident joint as a baseline proxy for the label issues. This
      sometimes works as well as ``filter.find_label_issues(confident_joint)``.


    Note
    ----

    We provide a for-loop based simplification of the confident joint
    below. This implementation is not efficient, not used in practice, and
    not complete, but covers the gist of how the confident joint is computed:

    .. code:: python

        # Confident examples are those that we are confident have true_label = k
        # Estimate (K, K) matrix of confident examples with label = k_s and true_label = k_y
        cj_ish = np.zeros((K, K))
        for k_s in range(K): # k_s is the class value k of noisy labels `s`
            for k_y in range(K): # k_y is the (guessed) class k of true_label k_y
                cj_ish[k_s][k_y] = sum((pred_probs[:,k_y] >= (thresholds[k_y] - 1e-8)) & (labels == k_s))

    The following is a vectorized (but non-parallelized) implementation of the
    confident joint, again slow, using for-loops/simplified for understanding.
    This implementation is 100% accurate, it's just not optimized for speed.

    estimate of latent variables `py` and the noise rates

    Important: this function assumes that `pred_probs` are out-of-sample
    holdout probabilities. This can be :ref:`done with cross validation <pred_probs_cross_val>`. If
    the probabilities are not computed out-of-sample, overfitting may occur.

    This function estimates the `noise_matrix` of shape ``(K, K)``. This is the
    fraction of examples in every class, labeled as every other class. The
    `noise_matrix` is a conditional probability matrix for ``P(label=k_s|true_label=k_y)``.

    Under certain conditions, estimates are exact, and in most
    conditions, estimates are within one percent of the actual noise rates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.array
      An array of shape ``(N,)`` of noisy labels, i.e. some labels may be erroneous.
      Elements must be in the set 0, 1, ..., K-1, where K is the number of classes.

    pred_probs : np.array
      An array of shape ``(N, K)`` of model-predicted probabilities,
      ``P(label=k|x)``. Each row of this matrix corresponds
      to an example `x` and contains the model-predicted probabilities that
      `x` belongs to each possible class, for each of the K classes. The
      columns must be ordered such that these probabilities correspond to
      class 0, 1, ..., K-1. `pred_probs` should have been computed using 3 (or
      higher) fold cross-validation.

    thresholds : array_like, optional
      An array of shape ``(K, 1)`` or ``(K,)`` of per-class threshold
      probabilities, used to determine the cutoff probability necessary to
      consider an example as a given class label (see `Northcutt et al.,
      2021 <https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125>`_, Section
      3.1, Equation 2).

      This is for advanced users only. If not specified, these are computed
      for you automatically. If an example has a predicted probability
      greater than this threshold, it is counted as having true_label =
      k. This is not used for pruning/filtering, only for estimating the
      noise rates using confident counts.

    converge_latent_estimates : bool, optional
      If ``True``, forces numerical consistency of estimates. Each is estimated
      independently, but they are related mathematically with closed form
      equivalences. This will iteratively make them mathematically consistent.

    py_method : {"cnt", "eqn", "marginal", "marginal_ps"}, default="cnt"
      How to compute the latent prior ``p(true_label=k)``. Default is ``"cnt"`` as it often
      works well even when the noise matrices are estimated poorly by using

    calibrate : bool, default=True
      Calibrates confident joint estimate ``P(label=i, true_label=j)`` such that
      ``np.sum(cj) == len(labels)`` and ``np.sum(cj, axis = 1) == np.bincount(labels)``.

    Notes: There are two ways to compute the confident joint with pros/cons.
    (1) For each holdout set, we compute the confident joint, then sum them up.
    (2) Compute pred_proba for each fold, combine, compute the confident joint.
    (1) is more accurate because it correctly computes thresholds for each fold
    (2) is more accurate when you have only a little data because it computes
    the confident joint using all the probabilities. For example if you had 100
    examples, with 5-fold cross validation + uniform p(y) you would only have 20
    examples to compute each confident joint for (1). Such small amounts of data
    is bound to result in estimation errors. For this reason, we implement (2),
    but we implement (1) as a commented out function at the end of this file.

    for some a certain number of iterations (3-10 works fine.)

    Do not set iterations too high or performance will decrease as small
    deviations will get perturbed over and over and potentially magnified.

    Note that we have to first converge the inverse_noise_matrix and py,
    then we can update the noise_matrix, then repeat. This is because the
    inverse noise matrix depends on py (which is unknown/latent), but the
    noise matrix depends on ps (which is known), so there will be no change in
    the noise matrix if we recompute it when py and inverse_noise_matrix change.


    Parameters
    ----------
    ps : np.array (shape (K, ) or (1, K))
        The fraction (prior probability) of each observed, NOISY class P(labels = k).

    py : np.array (shape (K, ) or (1, K))
        The estimated fraction (prior probability) of each TRUE class P(true_label = k).

    noise_matrix : np.array of shape (K, K), K = number of classes
        A conditional probability matrix of the form P(label=k_s|true_label=k_y) containing
        the fraction of examples in every class, labeled as every other class.
        Assumes columns of noise_matrix sum to 1.

    inverse_noise_matrix : np.array of shape (K, K), K = number of classes
        A conditional probability matrix of the form P(true_label=k_y|labels=k_s) representing
        the estimated fraction observed examples in each class k_s, that are
        mislabeled examples from every other class k_y. If None, the
        inverse_noise_matrix will be computed from pred_probs and labels.
        Assumes columns of inverse_noise_matrix sum to 1.

    inv_noise_matrix_iterations : int, default = 5
        Number of times to converge inverse noise matrix with py and noise mat.

    noise_matrix_iterations : int, default = 3
        Number of times to converge noise matrix with py and inverse noise mat.

    Returns
    ------
        Three np.arrays of the form (py, noise_matrix, inverse_noise_matrix) all
        having numerical agreement in terms of their mathematical relations."""

def get_confident_thresholds(labels: np.array, pred_probs: np.array) -> np.array:
    """Returns expected (average) "self-confidence" for each class.

    The confident class threshold for a class j is the expected (average) "self-confidence" for class j.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.array
      An array of shape ``(N,)`` of noisy labels, i.e. some labels may be erroneous.
      Elements must be in the set 0, 1, ..., K-1, where K is the number of classes.

    pred_probs : np.array
      An array of shape ``(N, K)`` of model-predicted probabilities,
      ``P(label=k|x)``. Each row of this matrix corresponds
      to an example `x` and contains the model-predicted probabilities that
      `x` belongs to each possible class, for each of the K classes. The
      columns must be ordered such that these probabilities correspond to
      class 0, 1, ..., K-1. `pred_probs` should have been computed using 3 (or
      higher) fold cross-validation.

    Returns
    -------
    confident_thresholds : np.array
      An array of shape ``(K,)``.
