"""
Methods to rank/order data by cleanlab's `label quality score`.
Except for :py:func:`order_label_issues <cleanlab.rank.order_label_issues>`, which operates only on the subset of the data identified
as potential label issues/errors, the methods in this module can be used on whichever subset
of the dataset you choose (including the entire dataset) and provide a `label quality score` for
every example. You can then do something like: ``np.argsort(label_quality_score)`` to obtain ranked
indices of individual data.

CAUTION: These label quality scores are computed based on `pred_probs` from your model that must be out-of-sample!
You should never provide predictions on the same examples used to train the model,
as these will be overfit and unsuitable for finding label-errors.
To obtain out-of-sample predicted probabilities for every datapoint in your dataset, you can use :ref:`cross-validation <pred_probs_cross_val>`.
Alternatively it is ok if your model was trained on a separate dataset and you are only evaluating
labels in data that was previously held-out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.array
      A discrete vector of noisy labels, i.e. some labels may be erroneous.
      *Format requirements*: for dataset with K classes, labels must be in 0, 1, ..., K-1.

    pred_probs : np.array, optional
      An array of shape ``(N, K)`` of model-predicted probabilities,
      ``P(label=k|x)``. Each row of this matrix corresponds
      to an example `x` and contains the model-predicted probabilities that
      `x` belongs to each possible class, for each of the K classes. The
      columns must be ordered such that these probabilities correspond to
      class 0, 1, ..., K-1.

      **Caution**: `pred_probs` from your model must be out-of-sample!
      You should never provide predictions on the same examples used to train the model,

      Alternatively it is ok if your model was trained on a separate dataset and you are only evaluating
      data that was previously held-out.

    method : {"self_confidence", "normalized_margin", "confidence_weighted_entropy"}, default="self_confidence"
      Label quality scoring method.

      Letting ``k = labels[i]`` and ``P = pred_probs[i]`` denote the given label and predicted class-probabilities
      for datapoint *i*, its score can either be:

      - ``'normalized_margin'``: ``P[k] - max_{k' != k}[ P[k'] ]``
      - ``'self_confidence'``: ``P[k]``
      - ``'confidence_weighted_entropy'``: ``entropy(P) / self_confidence``

      Let ``C = {0, 1, ..., K}`` denote the classification task's specified set of classes.

      The normalized_margin score works better for identifying class conditional label errors,
      i.e. examples for which another label in C is appropriate but the given label is not.

      The self_confidence score works better for identifying alternative label issues corresponding
      to bad examples that are: not from any of the classes in C, well-described by 2 or more labels in C,
      or generally just out-of-distribution (ie. anomalous outliers).

    adjust_pred_probs : bool, optional
      Account for class imbalance in the label-quality scoring by adjusting predicted probabilities
      via subtraction of class confident thresholds and renormalization.
      Set this to ``True`` if you prefer to account for class-imbalance.

    features : np.array
      Feature matrix of shape (N, M), where N is the number of datapoints and M is the number of features.
      This is the "query set" of features for each datapoint which are used for nearest neighbor search.

    nbrs : sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors
      Instantiated NearestNeighbors class object that's been fitted on a dataset in the same feature space.
      Note that the distance metric and n_neighbors is specified when instantiating this class.
      See: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html

    k : int, default=None
      Number of neighbors to use when calculating average distance to neighbors.
      This value k needs to be less than or equal to max_k which is the n_neighbors used when fitting instantiated NearestNeighbors class object.
      If k=None, then by default k=min(10, max_k) is used where max_k is extracted from the given nbrs.

    Returns
    -------
    avg_nbrs_distances : np.array
      Average distance to k-nearest neighbors for each datapoint which is used as a score for OOD detection.
